# Brain Researcher Review Playbook

Use this playbook for product and scientific review contributions.

## Purpose

This playbook turns community review into reproducible bug reports and scientific feedback that maintainers can act on quickly.

## Project Context

Brain Researcher is in a hardening phase:

1. Core product surfaces are live.
2. Main work now is reliability, scientific rigor, and clearer UX.
3. High-quality issue reports are the fastest path to improvement.

## Scope

Use this document for:

- Studio, MCP, NeuroKG, Hypothesis, Datasets, and docs review.
- Structured issue submission through `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`.

For benchmark task authoring details, use `benchmark/CONTRIBUTING_TASKS.md`.

## Universal Reporting Format

Use this order in every report:

1. Entry surface
2. Page URL(s)
3. Click path or reproduction steps
4. IDs and context (workflow/tool/task/node/sessionId/runId)
5. Expected behavior
6. Actual behavior
7. Suggested fix
8. Evidence (screenshots, logs, payload snippets, exact UI text)

## Reviewer Rules

1. Default to read-only review.
2. Do not click `Save governance` on Benchmark unless authorized.
3. Do not submit PHI, secrets, or private credentials.
4. Keep reports specific and ID-based.

4. Test boundary safety behavior
- Review standard:
1. Retrieval relevance
2. Schema/payload correctness
3. Execution reliability
4. Safety boundary enforcement

- URL: `https://brain-researcher.com`
- Click path:
1. New Chat
2. Set Intent/Data/Concepts/Pipeline
3. Observe blocked Verify line
4. Use `Review pipeline` and optionally `Ask Agent to fix`
- Review standard:
1. Block reason clarity
